# **Azure Policy**

Azure Policy helps to enforce organizational standards and to assess compliance at-scale. It also helps to bring your resources to compliance through bulk remediation for existing resources and automatic remediation for new resources.

Common use cases for Azure Policy include implementing governance for resource consistency, regulatory compliance, security, cost, and management. 

The Azure landing zones reference implementations use DINE Azure policies to help you achieve policy-driven governance within your Azure environment. 

### **Policy-driven governance**
Use Azure Policy to provide guardrails and ensure continued compliance with your organizations platform and the applications deployed onto it. Azure Policy also provides application owners with independence and a secure, unhindered path to the cloud.

Azure Policy and deployIfNotExist enables the autonomy in the platform, and reduces the operational burden as you scale your deployments and subscriptions in the Enterprise-Scale architecture. The primary purpose is to ensure that subscriptions and resources are compliant.
